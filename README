Some people wanted me to release the source code of my blogging system,
so I did the least possible amount of work in order to release it.
There's probably at least one thing about this that's broken for
anyone who wanted to use this who isn't me.

Apologies to Dan Cederholm for using the name Publish Jr. He had this
name first, way back in 2002.

A short guide:

* publishjr.php publishes to the site directory, which is a private
  copy of the site used to prevent downtime during site regeneration.
* update_site invokes this automatically then rsyncs to the site_public
  directory, which you should point your web-server at.
* updater.rb depends on inotify and rb-inotify, and calls update_site
  automatically when you make a change to your site.

You should set up config.json appropriately.
